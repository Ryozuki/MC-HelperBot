# MC-HelperBot
Questions can use regex! Find out what regex is here.

This plugin is a simple chat bot that will answer users questions without any need of a command.
Permissions:
    helperbot.* - Gives access to all helperbot commands
    helperbot.set - Allows user to set the bot name
    helperbot.answer - The bot will answer only users with this permission.

This is how the generated config.yml file looks like:
```yml
BotName: '<HelperBot>: '
IgnoreQuestionMark: true
QA:
  How (i|to) spawn: Try /spawn
  How are you: I'm fine thanks :P
```
 
IgnoreQuestionMark: if set to true it will ignore all "?", see the example image.
